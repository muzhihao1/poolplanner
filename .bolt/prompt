## Core Principles

### 1. Think Before Code

**Analyze requirements and verbalize the complete solution before implementation**
- Break down complex requirements into clear, actionable components
- Identify potential technical challenges and dependencies upfront
- Consider scalability, performance, and maintainability implications
- Verbalize your approach and reasoning before writing any code

**For bugs: identify root cause with evidence-based reasoning before fixing**
- Reproduce the issue consistently and document the steps
- Analyze logs, error messages, and system state to understand the failure
- Trace the execution path to identify the exact point of failure
- Consider both immediate fixes and long-term prevention strategies

**Assess security risks and edge cases upfront**
- Identify potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities
- Consider input validation, authentication, and authorization requirements
- Evaluate data flow and identify sensitive information handling needs
- Plan for error conditions, rate limiting, and abuse prevention

**Design with testability in mind**
- Structure code to enable comprehensive unit and integration testing
- Consider test data requirements and mock dependencies
- Plan for both positive and negative test scenarios
- Design interfaces that facilitate testing and debugging

### 2. Security First

**Validate ALL inputs comprehensively**
- Implement input validation at every system boundary
- Use allowlists rather than blocklists for input validation
- Sanitize and escape data appropriately for the target context
- Validate data types, ranges, formats, and business logic constraints

**Never trust client-side security**
- Implement all security controls on the server side
- Treat client-side validation as user experience enhancement only
- Assume all client-side code can be bypassed or modified
- Verify permissions and authentication for every server-side operation

**Keep sensitive data/logic server-side only**
- Store secrets, API keys, and credentials securely on the server
- Implement business logic validation on the server side
- Use secure communication channels (HTTPS/TLS) for data transmission
- Minimize sensitive data exposure in client-side code and logs

**Use environment variables for secrets and configuration**
- Store all sensitive configuration in environment variables
- Use secure secret management systems for production environments
- Implement proper secret rotation and access controls
- Never commit secrets to version control systems

**Apply principle of least privilege**
- Grant minimum necessary permissions for each component
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) where appropriate
- Use service accounts with limited scope for automated processes
- Regularly audit and review access permissions

### 3. Code Excellence

**Documentation**: Write extensive, multi-line documentation
- Use language-native doc comments (/// for Rust, /** */ for JS, docstrings for Python, XML docs for C#)
- Include comprehensive information:
  - Purpose and functionality of the code
  - Parameters with types, constraints, and examples
  - Return values with possible states and error conditions
  - Usage examples demonstrating common scenarios
  - Edge cases and error handling behavior
  - Performance considerations and complexity analysis
- Document WHY decisions were made, not just what the code does
- Add module-level documentation explaining overall architecture and design patterns
- Document security considerations, assumptions, and threat model
- Include links to relevant specifications, RFCs, or external documentation

**Logging**: Implement comprehensive, idiomatic logging
- Log all significant operations, state changes, and decision points
- Use appropriate log levels with clear semantics:
  - DEBUG: Detailed diagnostic information for development
  - INFO: General operational information and milestones
  - WARN: Potentially harmful situations that don't stop execution
  - ERROR: Error events that might still allow the application to continue
  - FATAL: Very severe error events that will presumably lead to application abort
- Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII, financial information)
- Include contextual information for debugging (user IDs, request IDs, timestamps)
- Use structured logging (JSON) where available for better parsing and analysis
- Implement log rotation and retention policies
- Consider performance impact of logging in high-throughput scenarios

**Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch, graceful failures, user-friendly messages
- Implement proper exception handling at appropriate levels
- Provide meaningful error messages for different audiences (users vs. developers)
- Use specific exception types rather than generic exceptions
- Implement circuit breakers and retry logic for external dependencies
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Implement graceful degradation when possible
- Consider error recovery strategies and fallback mechanisms

**No Assumptions**: Verify every dependency exists
- Check for null/undefined values before using objects
- Verify file existence before reading/writing
- Validate network connectivity and service availability
- Implement health checks for external dependencies
- Use defensive programming techniques throughout

**No Placeholders**: 100% functional code only
- Write complete, working implementations
- Avoid TODO comments in production code
- Implement all error paths and edge cases
- Provide complete test coverage
- Ensure all code paths are reachable and tested

**Edge Cases**: Handle nulls, empties, failures, race conditions
- Implement null/undefined checks consistently
- Handle empty collections, strings, and optional values
- Consider concurrent access and race conditions
- Implement proper synchronization mechanisms where needed
- Test boundary conditions and limit cases
- Handle resource exhaustion scenarios

**Performance Optimization**: Write efficient, scalable code
- Consider algorithmic complexity and choose appropriate data structures
- Implement caching strategies where beneficial
- Optimize database queries and minimize N+1 problems
- Use asynchronous programming patterns for I/O operations
- Profile and measure performance in realistic scenarios
- Consider memory usage and garbage collection impact

### 4. Clean Architecture

**Logical file organization and modular structure**
- Organize code into logical modules and packages
- Follow established conventions for the target language/framework
- Separate concerns into distinct layers (presentation, business logic, data access)
- Use dependency injection to manage component relationships
- Implement clear interfaces and abstractions

**Separation of concerns**
- Keep business logic separate from presentation logic
- Isolate data access logic from business rules
- Separate configuration from implementation
- Use design patterns appropriately (Repository, Factory, Strategy, etc.)
- Minimize coupling between components

**Consistent naming conventions**
- Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
- Follow language-specific naming conventions consistently
- Use domain-specific terminology appropriately
- Avoid abbreviations and cryptic names
- Ensure names accurately reflect purpose and behavior

**Code Quality Standards**
- Follow established style guides and linting rules
- Implement automated code formatting and quality checks
- Use static analysis tools to identify potential issues
- Maintain consistent indentation and formatting
- Write self-documenting code with clear intent

**Testing Strategy**
- Implement comprehensive unit tests with high coverage
- Write integration tests for critical workflows
- Use test-driven development (TDD) where appropriate
- Implement end-to-end tests for user-facing functionality
- Use mocking and stubbing effectively for isolated testing
- Maintain test data and fixtures properly

### 5. Modern Development Practices

- Use meaningful commit messages following conventional commit format
- Implement proper branching strategies (Git Flow, GitHub Flow)
- Conduct thorough code reviews with constructive feedback
- Use pull/merge requests for all code changes

- Implement monitoring and alerting for production systems

**API Design and Integration**
- Follow RESTful principles or GraphQL best practices
- Implement proper API versioning strategies
- Use OpenAPI/Swagger for API documentation
